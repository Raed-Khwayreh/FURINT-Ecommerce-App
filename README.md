You can sign in direct or create new account 

I have used Regular expression to check fields if its vaild

this expression (r"^[a-zA-Z0-9.a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+-/=?^_{|}~]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z]+) to check email
and this to check phone number (r"[05][69][23456789][0-9]{6}$") you can use only mobile start 059 and 056 because I have limited the app for Palestine ðŸ˜„

after login this is home page that show sliders for offers, categories, products
